# Support-Vector-Machine-for-Iris-Classification
The dataset consists of three classes of Iris flowers, and the model is trained to predict the species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV, and the model achieved an accuracy of 94% on the test set."
