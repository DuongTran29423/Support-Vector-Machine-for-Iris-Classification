# Machine Learning Project: Logistic Regression and SVM Implementation
## Project Overview
This project implements Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify datasets. It explores the performance of different classifiers and the application of Gradient Descent and Grid Search for model optimization. The project includes both batch gradient descent implementation and an example using the iris dataset for practical machine learning workflows.
